                <p>Always curious, I like to think my career truly began when I used my first desktop computer. 
    The wonder of a screen with so much magic inside of it, combined with the influence of my Electrical-Engineering father, 
    sparked the flame that took me to a leading Computer Science program.</p>
                <p>During my tenure at Virginia Tech, I was fortunate enough to land three internships- one every summer. 
    First, I worked with ATEC Wireless to develop a WPF-solution to an RF-signal decoding problem using C# and XAML.</p>
                <p>Next, I developed a Computer-Vision feature to automatically mark all symbols on any floor plan for Lutron Electronics, using the MVVM design pattern with C#, XAML, and SQL.</p>
                <p>This led to my final internship, building a complex data pipeline with Capital One. The work was challenging and exciting enough to bring me back for a full time position, where I currently spend my 9-to-5.</p>
